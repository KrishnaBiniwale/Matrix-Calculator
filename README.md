# Matrix-Calculator

This program can perform operations on matrices.

These operations include: 

Key | Operations
--- | ----------
1:  | Create Matrix
2:  | Delete Matrix
3:  | Change Current Matrix
4:  | Print Current Matrix
5:  | Print All Matrices
6:  | Find Determinant
7:  | Multiply Matrices
0:  | Quit

Currently, these operations are limited to 2D vectors. However, I am planning to implement 3D vectors eventually.
